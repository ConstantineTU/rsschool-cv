## About me

All my life I looked towards IT technologies, it seemed to me that I was far from this, although the computer accompanied me in all spheres of my life, school, university, work, home. The desire for self-development and moving forward pushed to the study of frontend development and I became very happy when I finally realized that programming is my vocation, what the dream of my whole life lies in. The main goal is motivation to learn new technologies.
I feel that the conquest of the world is getting closer every day ...

      return a-b
      }    
    if(arif==="multiply"){
